In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, specifically when an object is deallocated while still being observed.  If an observer isn't removed before the observed object is deallocated, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. This is because the observer might try to access memory that no longer exists.

Example:

```objectivec
@interface MyObservedObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *someProperty;
@end

@implementation MyObservedObject
// ... implementation ...
@end

@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Accessing the object here after it's deallocated can lead to a crash
}

@end

// ... in some other class ...
MyObservedObject *observedObject = [[MyObservedObject alloc] init];
MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
[observedObject addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@
