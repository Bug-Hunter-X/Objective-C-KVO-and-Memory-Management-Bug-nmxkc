This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management. The bug occurs when an observer attempts to access an object that has already been deallocated, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior. The solution involves properly removing the observer before the observed object is deallocated using `removeObserver`. The provided code examples highlight both the problematic and corrected implementations.
