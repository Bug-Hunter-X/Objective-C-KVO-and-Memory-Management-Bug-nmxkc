To fix this issue, ensure that you remove the observer using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` before the observed object is deallocated.  This should happen in the `dealloc` method of the observer, or anytime before the observed object's deallocation.

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... your observation logic ...
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [observedObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@
